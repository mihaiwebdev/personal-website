        In my 2 years of experience I've developed web applications using technologies like Angular, React and Node.
        I completed <b>Harvard's CS50</b> courses in Computer Science and Web Programming and have finished 20 courses overall.
    
   
        I've developed numerous personal projects in my free time out of passion, including a Pathfinding Visualizer
        that earned <b>3rd place</b> in a local coding competition. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Notably, <b>I've been a speaker</b> at two tech events, presenting web applications, and built a movie
        recommendation app that has achieved a <b>user base of 1,400</b> and reached a peak of <b>100 daily active
        users</b>.
